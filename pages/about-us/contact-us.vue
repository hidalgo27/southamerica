        At SouthAmerica, our Destination Specialists work in teams that focus on specific regions of the world so they
        can go
        deeper and become true experts who know more than your typical travel advisor. They also draw on their wealth of
        experiences, not only as travel professionals but as travellers and people with diverse interests. When working
        with SouthAmerica, you don’t get cookie cutter advice and travel planning help. You get expert service from
        passionate
        travellers who have dedicated their lives, personally and professionally, to exploring the world.

      <p class="text-md mb-6">
        Regardless of the situation, our team is there to provide emergency support and assistance. The first and best
        resource is your SouthAmerica travel document, which has the contact details for our local representatives and
        suppliers. When travelling, our local representatives should be your first point of contact as they can often
        resolve issues quickly and give appropriate guidance. If you have trouble contacting our local offices or need
        urgent assistance, contact SouthAmerica directly.
